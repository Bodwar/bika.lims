Client Contacts. Client Users
=============================
Adding and editing Client Contacts and their publication preferences.

Bika LIMS differentiates between Client organisations and their people, Client Contacts. Analyses are requested by, and results published to, a Client's Contacts. Clients must be defined in the system before they can submit analysis requests and populate their preferences and Contact details.

The Clients folder on the navigation bar lists current laboratory Clients. Client Contacts do not see the Clients folder on the navigation bar but are exclusively limited to their own organisation's data only. Only lab staff have access to all Clients.

Clients Contacts cannot be deleted, but can be de-activated and will then be excluded form standard view. They are listed on 'dormant' lists from where they may be re-activated again.

Note that not all Client Contacts set up for the Client organisation have to be LIMS users and may for instance include admin personnel, to keep their Contact details on record, and QC staff that are cc'd with analysis results.

Contacts' Tabs
--------------

Client Contacts have 2 main tabs, Edit and Login details and the former have sub-tabs as shown.

The Client Contact person is defined, and using the [next] button, their addresses and publication preferences.

The Contact's Email address is important as that is the address that will be used for the Contact's emailed analysis results as well as lost password requests.

Publication preferences
-----------------------

Publication preferences specify the media in which the results of an analysis request requested for that Client Contact should be returned. This may be by fax, email, print, pdf or csv - in the latter case, results are returned as comma delimited spreadsheet attachment to emails.

If selected, the SMS option will inform the Contact by SMS text when their results are published - it is a notification only and at this stage does not include the results itself.

Click on the Publication preference tab of the Contact you are editing for the tab to open.

Highlight the Contact's preferred publication methods. Selected preferences are shown in orange. To select more than one preference, hold the [Ctrl] key on your keyboard down while clicking on the preference you want to select.

NB. Some earlier versions offers only email and will automatically attach a PDF. The other media, CSV, Fax, Print, SMS etc. will be added after passing tests upon migration from Inkosi Bika 2.

The Attachments Permitted field should be checked if it is OK for the Client Contact tor receive analysis results file attachments, such as microscope images, by email.
These can be bulky and is best not allowed for Contacts on slow Internet connections and who do not critically require the attachments. They can always browse to the attachments when they really need to see them.

E-mailed results for the Contact can be cc'd to any of the Clients' other Contacts by selecting them in Contacts to cc field, typically accounts departments or QC management colleagues. These selected Contacts will then be added to the analysis request forms for this Contact by default.

User account and login
----------------------

Not all Client Contacts have to be LIMS users. Administrative Contact information can also be kept her to make it easier for lab staff to look this information up should they need to phone or email them.

Once the Client Contact has been defined, and he/she needs to access the system, it is necessary to define a UserID for that person. This is done using the login details subtab.

Client Contacts are able to create new Client Contacts for their company, but they are not permitted to create login details for the new Contact. This must be requested from the lab personnel.

Complete the fields in the form - note that the system can also be configured, preferably to generate passwords itself, in which case the initial password entry fields won't be displayed.

Once the Client Contact has a login defined, a confirmation message is presented and a confirmation email sent to him/her. The new user follows a link in the email to confirm his/her identity.

The the new Client Contact user may now log into the system to submit analysis requests, orders and edit set-up data like analysis profiles and specifications, and to view results.
