Analysis Specifications
=======================

Setting up valid ranges for results. Per Sample Type. Any result captured outside of the range specified, will raise an alert.
 	 
All the 'product' Specifications for analytical services offered by your lab are listed here per Sample Type and editable to lab managers.

The same functionality is available to clients in their own set-up areas where they may maintain their own Specifications. On Analysis Request results views, users may then apply either the laboratory's Specifications or that of the the Client who the samples and data belong. This is very handy for the clients themselves, who might have different standards to that of the lab

Results outside of the selected range are highlighted on their views in Worksheets and results publications, etc.

In the lab, staff may then take measures such as entering rejection or re-testing workflows

Creating and editing Analysis Specifications
--------------------------------------------

Click on [Add Analysis Specification] to add a new Specification, or click on the title of an existing service to edit it.

If you want to deactivate a Specification, check the box opposite its title and press [deactivate] at the bottom of the page.

Creating a new Specification, the user has to select for which Sample Type on the new Specification's description tab. If the user is editing an existing Specification, its Sample Types will be selected already:

Select the Sample Type you want to set Specifications for. More than one Sample Type may be selected but all selected Sample Types will then get the same Specifications

Valid range
-----------

On the Valid range tab, enter the minimum, maximum and percentage error for that Sample Type. 

Click on [Save] to apply your set-up

When a results is submitted it is compared to the minimum and maximum values for its Sample Type Specification, also depending whether the lab or client Specifications are selected. If the limits are not exceeded it is reported normally as 'in range'

If the result exceeds the limits, the error percentage is applied to it and it is again measured against the valid range limits. If it then falls in range, it is reported as 'in error range'. If it is still over the limits, it is reported as 'out of range'
